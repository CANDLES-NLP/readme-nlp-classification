If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it would have been terrible.\\nEvery data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I didn\\'t know how they worked\\nunder the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was running would give an \"out of\\nmemory\" error, and then I\\'d have to find a workaround. I used a few multidimensional arrays in my life and\\nthousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from scratch.\\n\\nIt\\'s a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of this already it will take you a lot less time.\\n\\n## How to use it\\n\\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order from top to bottom.\\n\\nI\\'m using GitHub\\'s special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track progress.\\n\\n**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in the brackets: [x]**\\n\\n    Fork a branch and follow the commands below\\n\\nFork the GitHub repo https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university by clicking on the Fork button.\\n\\nClone to your local repo:\\n\\n    git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/coding-interview-university.git\\n    git checkout -b progress\\n    git remote add jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university\\n    git fetch --all\\n\\nMark all boxes with X after you completed your changes:\\n\\n    git add .\\n    git commit -m \"Marked x\"\\n    git rebase jwasham/main\\n    git push --set-upstream origin progress\\n    git push --force\\n\\n[More about GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)\\n\\n## Don\\'t feel you aren\\'t smart enough\\n\\n- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that they aren\\'t smart enough.\\n- [The myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ)\\n- [It\\'s Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY)\\n\\n## A Note About Video Resources\\n\\nSome videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. These are called MOOCs.\\nSometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of months, so you have no access.\\n\\nIt would be great to replace the online course resources with free and always-available public sources, \\nsuch as YouTube videos (preferably university lectures), so that you people can study these anytime, \\nnot just when a specific online course is in session.\\n\\n## Choose a Programming Language\\n\\nYou\\'ll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you do, \\nbut you\\'ll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer science concepts.\\n\\nPreferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be proficient in one.\\n\\n### For this Study Plan\\n\\nWhen I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python\\n\\n* C: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation/deallocation, so you feel the data structures \\n    and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or Java, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that\\'s terrific,\\n    but when you\\'re learning how these low-level data structures are built, it\\'s great to feel close to the metal.\\n    - C is everywhere. You\\'ll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *everywhere* while you\\'re studying.\\n    - [The C Programming Language, Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)\\n        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the C language and if you practice it a little\\n            you\\'ll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you understand how programs and memory work.\\n        - You don\\'t need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). Just get to where you\\'re comfortable reading and writing in C.\\n        - [Answers to questions in the book](https://github.com/lekkas/c-algorithms)\\n* Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it\\'s just super useful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.\\n\\nThis is my preference.

There may be caveats:\\n\\n- JavaScript\\n- Ruby\\n\\nHere is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview: \\n[Pick One Language for the Coding Interview](https://startupnextdoor.com/important-pick-one-language-for-the-coding-interview/).\\nThis is the original article my post was based on: http://blog.codingforinterviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/\\n\\nYou need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.\\n\\nRead more about choices: \\n- [Choose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview](http://www.byte-by-byte.com/choose-the-right-language-for-your-coding-interview/)\\n\\n[See language-specific resources here](programming-language-resources.md)\\n\\n## Books for Data Structures and Algorithms\\n\\nThis book will form your foundation for computer science.\\n\\nJust choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with.

And you\\'ll save months of time.\\n\\n### 1. You Won\\'t Remember it All\\n\\nI watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there was much I didn\\'t remember. I spent 3 days going\\nthrough my notes and making flashcards, so I could review. I didn\\'t need all of that knowledge.\\n\\nPlease, read so you won\\'t make my mistakes:\\n\\n[Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retaining-computer-science-knowledge/).\\n\\n### 2. Use Flashcards\\n\\nTo solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add flashcards of 2 types: general and code.\\nEach card has different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I could review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am.\\n\\nMake your own for free:\\n\\n- [Flashcards site repo](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards)\\n\\n**I DON\\'T RECOMMEND using my flashcards.** There are too many and many of them are trivia that you don\\'t need.\\n\\nBut if you don\\'t want to listen to me, here you go:\\n- [My flash cards database (1200 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham.db):\\n- [My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham-extreme.db):\\n\\nKeep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assembly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics. \\nIt\\'s way too much for what\\'s required.\\n\\n**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, don\\'t mark it as known. You have to see the\\nsame card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. Repetition will put that knowledge deeper in\\nyour brain.\\n\\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), which has been recommended to me numerous times. \\nIt uses a repetition system to help you remember. It\\'s user-friendly, available on all platforms and has a cloud sync system. \\nIt costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\\n\\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173560 (thanks [@xiewenya](https://github.com/xiewenya)).\\n\\nSome students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be fixed by doing the following: open deck, edit card, click cards, select the \"styling\" radio button, add the member \"white-space: pre;\" to the card class.\\n\\n### 3. Do Coding Interview Questions While You\\'re Learning\\n\\nTHIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.\\n\\nStart doing coding interview questions while you\\'re learning data structures and algorithms.\\n\\nYou need to apply what you\\'re learning to solving problems, or you\\'ll forget. I made this mistake. \\n\\nOnce you\\'ve learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for example, **linked lists**:\\n1. Open one of the [coding interview books](#interview-prep-books) (or coding problem websites, listed below) \\n1. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists. \\n1. Move on to the next learning topic.\\n1. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.\\n1. Do this with each new topic you learn. \\n\\n**Keep doing problems while you\\'re learning all this stuff, not after.**\\n\\nYou\\'re not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.\\n\\nThere are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going.\\n\\n### 4. Focus\\n\\nThere are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and concentration are hard. Turn on some music\\nwithout lyrics and you\\'ll be able to focus pretty well.\\n\\n## What you won\\'t see covered\\n\\nThese are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\\n\\n- SQL\\n- Javascript\\n- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies\\n\\n## The Daily Plan\\n\\nThis course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few days, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.\\n\\nEach day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that subject, and then write an implementation \\nof that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this course.\\n\\nYou can see my code here:\\n - [C](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c)\\n - [C++](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp)\\n - [Python](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python)\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to understand it enough to be able to write your own implementation.\\n\\n## Coding Question Practice\\n\\n    Why is this here? I\\'m not ready to interview.\\n\\n[Then go back and read this.](#3-do-coding-interview-questions-while-youre-learning)\\n\\nWhy you need to practice doing programming problems:\\n- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms fit in\\n- Gathering requirements for the problem\\n- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview\\n- Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer\\n- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions (see Big-O below)\\n- Testing your solutions\\n\\nThere is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an interview.
